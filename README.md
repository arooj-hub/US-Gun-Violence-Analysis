# US Gun Violence Analysis

## Project Overview
Gun violence is a major public safety concern in the United States. This project analyzes **gun-related incidents** across different states and cities, identifying trends, patterns, and risk factors.

## Key Objectives
- **Explore geographic & temporal trends** in gun violence.
- **Identify correlations** between firearms involved and fatalities.
- **Use clustering techniques** to categorize incidents based on severity.
- **Perform time-series analysis** to detect seasonal patterns.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` → Raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for **Exploratory, Regression, Clustering, and Time-Series** analysis.
- `scripts/` → Python scripts used for analysis.
- `visuals/` → Graphs and plots used in reports.
- `reports/` → Summary findings and key insights.

## Key Insights
- **Certain states and cities** have significantly higher gun violence rates.
- **Incidents involving multiple firearms** tend to have **higher fatalities**.
- **Gun violence is more frequent on weekends** and during **specific seasons**.
- **Cluster analysis reveals different types of incidents**, allowing law enforcement to prioritize high-risk areas.

## Next Steps
- **Incorporate socio-economic factors** (e.g., poverty, unemployment rates).
- **Develop predictive models** for forecasting gun violence trends.
- **Analyze the impact of gun laws** on incident rates.
